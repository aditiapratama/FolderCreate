Creates a folder structure based on a YAML template. For an example of such a YAML template, see ```VFX.yaml``` in the ```\templates``` folder. All new templates have to be saved there in order for the script to find them.

## Usage:
~~```python FolderCreate.py VFX.yaml d:\projects\newproject```~~

Added a GUI - Select the target folder from the Directory Selector, the template from the dropdown and click "Create Folders".
